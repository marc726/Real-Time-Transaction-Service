I would host the application using AWS. From what I researched, I would want to utilizeÂ AWS Elastic Beanstalk because of the simplicity it brings to 
allow me to deploy and manage the application. It supports Java as well as Spring Boot.

I would implement a database to maintain information and choose Amazon RDS to host either MySQL or Postgres due to its awesome feature of automatic backups.

Another aspect I'd like to consider is CI/CD. I would use AWS once again via CodePipeline. It would automatically build, test, and deploy the application whenever 
changes are pushed to the repo.

Rewrite the readme.md (using .md formatting) and refactor it so it seems like my personal project with instructions how to run, what I did, libraries/frameworks used, etc. 
Anything that makes it look and sound complete and professional
